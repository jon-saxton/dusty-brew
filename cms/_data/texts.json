  "-5fb20d98": "Can I use a blade grinder for espresso?",
  "-c21234f": "While it is possible to use a blade grinder for espresso, it is generally not recommended.

For espresso, you will need a finer grind, while for drip coffee, you will need a coarser grind. It is also a good idea to clean out the grinder between uses to avoid any flavor cross-contamination.",

It's part of how we make the whole process hassle-free, you don't have to worry about updates breaking your site because we manage it for you.

  "26ac1a4d": "In the first 24 months of your subscription, your monthly payments act as a payment plan toward the full value of your website. If you decide to cancel at any time, we'll certainly miss you! You'll need to pay off your remaining balance, and then we can send you the site files for you to host anywhere you want.",
  "72da678d": "After 24 months, your lowered payment covers hosting, maintenance, associated fees, and of course your unlimited update service. If you want to cancel, just send us a note and we'll send you your site files, no questions asked.",
