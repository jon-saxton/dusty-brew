**Buying Guide**
----------------

When it comes to buying a coffee grinder, there are a few key features to consider. Here are three important ones to keep in mind:

### **Grind Settings**

The number of grind settings a grinder has is important because it determines how much control you have over the size of your grind. If you’re a coffee connoisseur, you’ll want a grinder with a lot of grind settings so you can fine-tune your brew to perfection. If you’re just looking for a solid, dependable grinder, a few dozen grind settings should suffice.

#### Our Pick: [Baratza Virtuoso+](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Virtuoso-Conical-Grinder-Digital/dp/B07QMY8GLX/ref=sr_1_2?crid=HJEOWK2N75R3&keywords=Baratza+Virtuoso%2B&qid=1672602780&sprefix=baratza+virtuoso%2B%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-2&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0)

The Baratza Virtuoso+ is our top pick for the best coffee grinder in terms of grind settings. With 40 grind settings to choose from, it’s versatile enough to handle a wide variety of brewing methods.

### **Burr Type**

The type of burr a grinder has is important because it determines how well it can grind your beans. Conical burrs are generally considered to be the best because they can grind beans more evenly and consistently. Flat burrs are also a good choice, but they can generate more heat and potentially affect the flavor of your coffee.

#### Our Pick: [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/ref=sr_1_2?crid=279NY2RNYRFO2&keywords=Baratza+Encore&qid=1672602517&sprefix=baratza+encore%2Caps%2C134&sr=8-2&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0)

The Baratza Encore is our top pick for the best coffee grinder in terms of burr type. Its conical burrs are made of high-quality steel, which helps to preserve the flavor and aroma of your coffee beans.

### **Motor Power**

The power of a grinder’s motor is important because it determines how well it can handle tough beans. A powerful motor can grind through even the toughest beans with ease, while a weaker motor might struggle.

#### Our Pick: [Rancilio HSD-ROC-SD Rocky](https://www.amazon.com/Rancilio-HSD-ROC-SS-Espresso-Grinder-Chamber/dp/B00H1OUSL4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6MSJ7R76WTVS&keywords=Rancilio+HSD-ROC-SD+Rocky&qid=1672602713&sprefix=rancilio+hsd-roc-sd+rocky%2Caps%2C112&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.c3015c4a-46bb-44b9-81a4-dc28e6d374b3)
