FAQ

### What is shade-grown coffee and how does it differ from regular coffee?

Shade-grown coffee is coffee that is grown under the canopy of trees, rather than in full sun. This type of coffee production helps to preserve natural ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as reducing the need for water and pesticides. It also helps to support local communities and provide a fair and ethical working environment. Shade-grown coffee tends to have a more complex and nuanced flavor profile than regular coffee, as the trees provide additional nutrients and shelter for the coffee plants.

### How can I tell if a coffee is shade-grown?

There are several ways to tell if a coffee is shade-grown. One way is to look for certifications, such as Rainforest Alliance Certified or Fair Trade Certified. These certifications ensure that the coffee has been produced in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. You can also look for specific labeling or branding that indicates that the coffee is shade-grown. Additionally, you can research the specific region where the coffee is grown and check if it is known for producing shade-grown coffee.

### How do I store shade-grown coffee to keep it fresh?

To store shade-grown coffee and keep it fresh, it's best to keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing it in the fridge or freezer, as the fluctuating temperatures can cause the coffee to lose its flavor and aroma. If you have a large quantity of coffee that you won't be able to use within a few weeks, consider dividing it into smaller portions and freezing it in airtight containers or bags. This will help to preserve the freshness and flavor of the coffee.

### How can I support shade-grown coffee production and sustainability efforts?

There are several ways you can support shade-grown coffee production and sustainability efforts. One way is to purchase shade-grown coffee from reputable brands that are committed to sustainability and ethical sourcing. Look for certifications such as Rainforest Alliance Certified or Fair Trade Certified, and do your research on the specific sourcing and production practices of the brand. You can also support local coffee roasters and shops that offer shade-grown coffee options. Additionally, you can get involved with organizations that promote and support sustainable coffee production, such as the Specialty Coffee Association's Sustainable Coffee Program or the World Wildlife Fund's Coffee and Biodiversity Initiative. Finally, you can spread the word about the importance of shade-grown coffee and encourage others to make environmentally and socially responsible choices when it comes to their coffee consumption.
